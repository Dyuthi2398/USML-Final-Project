**Music Recommendation System**

The goal of this project is to create a Music recommendation system based on unsupervised machine learning recommendation approaches that find and recommend similar music based on the user's preferences
-Approach 1: Content Based Recommendation System. In this task, we have used K-Means clustering algorithm to cluster songs based numeric audio features like valence, acousticness, danceability etc to recommend songs based on artist, genre and song names.
-Approach 2: Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System In this task, songs are recommended based on similar userâ€™s preferences with the help of KNN and SVD         algorithm.



We have implemented five variations of the models:

    Baseline XGBoost Ranker using Tfidf vectors
    Cosine Similarity on Fasttext Word embeddings
    Pre-trained DistillBERT model
    Pre-trained Roberta Model
    Pre-trained XLNet Model

Additionally we have implemented three variations of ensemble models:

    Ensemble of equal weightage to DistillBERT, Roberta and XLNet Model
    Ensemble of different weightage to DistillBERT, Roberta(50%) and XLNet Model
    Ensemble of equal weightage to DistillBERT and Roberta Model

We were able to achieve the score of 0.84 using the Ensemble model of DistilBert and Roberta Models.
